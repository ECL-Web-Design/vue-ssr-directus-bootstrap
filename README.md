# Vite SSR Directus Quickstart Template

This template contains all the essential structure to set a vue ssr website with a directus + nginx backend.

Each noteworthy folder contains a readme with information on how to configure and install the contained files.

This template is meant to be modified at will to suit your specific project rather than acting as a framework.

# Getting Started

Run `npm vite-ssr dev` to start the client dev build, you will see a page containing the navbar, 404 page, and the
footer

Before the server is started the client has nothing to fetch and display.

## SERVER
